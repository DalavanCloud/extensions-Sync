[% error_message = BLOCK %]
  [% IF    error == '' %]
  
Coding error: no error tag specified.

  [% ELSIF error == 'bad_user' %]

Cannot log in as '[% user %]'. Perhaps this email address does not represent a valid user in this database?

  [% ELSIF error == 'bad_device_name' %]

Value '[% value %]' is not a valid value in field '[% field %]'.
[% IF bug.id %]
Bug [% bug.id %].
[% END %]
[% IF bug.cf_refnumber %]
External ID: [% bug.cf_refnumber %].

This is a fatal error. Bug cannot be modified. Check that the inbound mappings are up to date for the Bugzilla field '[% field %]'.

  [% ELSIF error == 'bad_field_value' %]

Cannot get ID of value '[% value %]' in field [% field %].

  [% ELSIF error == 'cant_create_bug' %]
  [% USE Dumper %]
  
Can't create bug. The information used to create the bug was as follows:

[%+ Dumper.dump(bug) %]

However, if we attempted to set an invalid value and it was rejected, it will 
not appear in the above dump. In that case, other errors may pin down a more 
specific cause.

  [% ELSIF error == 'component_without_product' %]

Attempted to get ID of component [% value %] without having a product ID set; this is not possible due to name non-uniqueness.

  [% ELSIF error == 'got_update_for_unsynced_bug' %]

Update was sent for bug [% bug_id %] (external ID '[% ext_id %]') but this bug is not marked as being synced.

  [% ELSIF error == 'mismatched_ids' %]

The remote system sent a message which associated bug ID '[% bug.id %]' with the remote ID [% ext_id %]. However, those two IDs are not associated in Bugzilla.
[% IF bug.cf_refnumber %]
Bugzilla thinks that bug [% bug.id %] is associated with external ID [% bug.cf_refnumber %].
[% ELSE %]
Bugzilla does not think that bug [% bug.id %] is associated with any external ID.
[% END %]

  [% ELSIF error == 'no_instruction' %]

No known instruction in part of map '[% map_name %]': params are '[% params %]'.

  [% ELSIF error == 'no_xpath_for_key' %]

No XPath is given in the XPath map for the key [% key %].

  [% ELSIF error == 'unknown_bug_id' %]

The remote system sent a message referencing the bug ID '[% bug_id %]', but no such bug exists in Bugzilla. [% IF ext_id %]The remote system's ID was 
[% ext_id %].[% END %]

[% struct %]

  [% ELSIF error == 'xml_parsing_failed' %]

[% IF filename %] 
 which you can find in the file [% filename %]

  [% ELSIF error == 'xml_validation_failed' %]

Some XML failed to validate. It has been stored in the file: [% filename %]. 

Error: [% message %]

If this XML was an outgoing message, it has not been sent. If it was an incoming message, it has not been parsed and applied.

    [% error_message = Hook.process("errors") %]

    [% IF not error_message %]

      Please send email to [% Param("maintainer") %] describing the steps taken
