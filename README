Bugzilla Sync Extension
-----------------------

This is an extension for asynchronous (i.e. non-real-time) synchronization of 
data from Bugzilla to another system. It provides generic services, and requires
you to write an extension to integrate with the specific system you have in 
mind. Please see the perldoc in the individual files, particularly Extension.pm,
for an idea of how to use it.

This software is stable and in production for syncing between a Bugzilla and
two different remote systems with very different syncing styles.

Configuration
-------------

Once you have installed this software and run checksetup.pl successfully,
you need to manually configure Bugzilla by hand in the following ways:

* Configure the cf_sync_data custom field to only appear in really unlikely 
  circumstances (e.g. when Product is set to 'Trash'). This is easier then
  hiding the field completely, and allows it to be re-shown for debugging.
